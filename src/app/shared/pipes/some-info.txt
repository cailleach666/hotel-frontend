Using methods to transform data in Angular templates is not considered good
practice primarily due to performance and maintainability concerns. When methods
are called in templates, they can be executed multiple times during Angular's
change detection cycle, which may lead to unnecessary computations and slow down
the rendering process. In contrast, pipes are designed to be pure functions that
only execute when their input data changes, resulting in more efficient rendering.
Moreover, pipes promote a cleaner separation of concerns by keeping transformation
logic out of the template, making the code easier to read and maintain. They also
enhance reusability, as custom pipes can be applied across various components
without duplicating logic.
